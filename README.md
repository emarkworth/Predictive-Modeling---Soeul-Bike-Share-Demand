# Using an Ensemble Model to Predict Bike Share Demand in Seoul

In this project, I examine the Seoul Bike Sharing Demand data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. I create an ensemble model using kNN, linear regression, and decision tree regression to predict the number of bike-share bikes rented in any given hour in Seoul, South Korea. The data set contains information about the number of bikes rented per hour for each day from December 2017 to the end of November 2018. There is also information on weather and holiday status for each entry.
